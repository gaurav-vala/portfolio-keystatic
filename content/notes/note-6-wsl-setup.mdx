# Setting Up Ubuntu 24.04 in WSL with VS Code ‚Äì A Beginner's Guide with Fixes

Setting up a Linux environment inside Windows using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) can be a game-changer for developers. However, the first-time setup often comes with a few hurdles. Here‚Äôs a guide documenting my setup experience, the issues I faced, and how I solved them.

---

## üöÄ Initial Setup

1. **Install WSL and Ubuntu 24.04**
   * From PowerShell (as admin):

     ```
     wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04


     ```
   * Launch Ubuntu from Start Menu and complete installation.
2. **Verify Installation**

   ```
   lsb_release -a
   echo "Hello from Linux!"
   ls


   ```

   This confirms WSL is working.

## üß≠ Navigating the File System

* Default directory: `/root` or `/home/<your-user>`.
* You can list directories with:

  ```
  ls


  ```

---

## üìÅ Creating a Projects Directory

1. Create and enter the folder:

   ```
   mkdir -p ~/projects && cd ~/projects


   ```
2. Clone a GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/user/repo-name.git>
   cd repo-name


   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Opening Projects in VS Code

### ‚úÖ Recommended

* Launch VS Code first.
* Click **Remote Explorer > WSL Targets**.
* Select Ubuntu 24.04.
* Then, open the folder graphically from there.

### ‚ùå Problem: `code: not found`

**Fix:**

* Open VS Code in Windows.
* Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type:

  ```
  Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH


  ```

### ‚ùå Problem: `sudo: not found`

**Fix:**

* Make sure you're using a proper Ubuntu WSL install (not a stripped-down rootfs or broken distro).
* You can reset or reinstall using:

  ```
  wsl --unregister Ubuntu-24.04
  wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04


  ```

### ‚ùå Problem: "Unable to open folder"

**Fix:**

* This typically means the folder path is broken or VS Code WSL extension didn‚Äôt load properly.
* Open the folder via:

  ```
  \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-24.04\\home\\<username>\\projects


  ```

## üìÇ Opening File Manager from WSL

```
explorer.exe .


```

This opens the current WSL path in Windows File Explorer.

## üóÉÔ∏è Working with a D: Drive Projects Folder in WSL

If your actual project files are stored in another drive like `D:\\Projects`, you can access and work on them in WSL without changing your setup.

### ‚úÖ Access D: Drive Directly in WSL

```
cd /mnt/d/Projects
ls
code .


```

### ‚úÖ Create a Symlink to D: Projects in WSL Home

```
ln -s /mnt/d/Projects ~/projects
cd ~/projects


```

This keeps you in your home structure but links to your Windows files.

### ‚úÖ Open in VS Code (Inside WSL)

```
cd ~/projects
code .


```

## üß© Helpful Commands

```
whoami           # Get current Linux user
cd ~             # Go to home directory
mkdir folder     # Create a folder
ls -la           # List all files with permissions
code .           # Open current directory in VS Code


```

## üìå Tips

* Pin your WSL home directory in Quick Access:
  * Open File Explorer
  * Navigate to: `\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-24.04\\home\\your-user`
  * Right-click > Pin to Quick Access
