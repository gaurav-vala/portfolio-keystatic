1 note is a note

2 notes is an interval

Atleast 3 notes is a Chord

2 types of chords&#x20;

\- Major Chords - Happy

\- Minor Chords - Melancholic

Add a single note, then add 7 notes on top of it, it's called fifth interval neutral

The interval with first note and last note called neutral that means it's not major Chord minor Chord, the middle note between these 2 notes will decide if the chord is major or minor

If you count 3 notes up and delete others, everytime you have a 2 note space between last note and middle note it is a minor Chord
