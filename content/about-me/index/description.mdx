## Hey, I’m Gaurav!

I’m a curious (and slightly clumsy) front-end developer who loves designing and building things — mostly to solve my own one or two everyday problems. I’m not building the next big startup (yet), but I’m always working on something that makes me go, “Hey, that’s actually kinda cool.”

I spend my time experimenting with React, Astro, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, making web apps that look clean and feel good to use. Some of my favorite projects include a habit-tracking PWA, an expense tracker, an anime schedule viewer, and a journal publication dashboard — all made with way too much curiosity and caffeine.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually lost in sci-fi or mythological fiction, binging anime or manga, or making beats and melodies just because I can. I love learning new things — if something sparks my curiosity, I’ll probably end up deep-diving into it until 3 AM.

At the end of the day, I just like creating things I can proudly show my parents and brother — projects that feel personal, fun, and a little bit me.
