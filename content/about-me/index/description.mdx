I am a curious but clumsy frontend guy. I like designing and building things. Although I am not building anything big, most of the time I am just trying to solve my 1,2 problems. At the end I am just making things that I can proudly show to my parents and brother.

I like to read books (Mostly Sci-fi and Mythological Fiction), for past 3 years I am big into Anime and Mangas. I like to make music also which is mainly making beats and melodies electronically, as my curiosity get the best of me, I just like to do or learn anything that makes me curious.
